Update is also possible using POST command.
Elasticsearch POST and PUT work the same but in POST Easlticsearch reterives the document, changes and reindexes the document.
So again this means documents are immutable.

"doc" is wrapped around.

POST /vehicles/car/123/_update
{
  "doc":{

  "price":20000.97
  }
}

{
  "_index": "vehicles",
  "_type": "car",
  "_id": "123",
  "_version": 5,
  "result": "updated",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  }
}
